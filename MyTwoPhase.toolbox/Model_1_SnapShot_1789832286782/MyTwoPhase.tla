(***************************************************************************)
(* This specification is discussed in "Two-Phase Commit", Lecture 6 of the *)
(* TLA+ Video Course.  It describes the Two-Phase Commit protocol, in      *)
(* which a transaction manager (TM) coordinates the resource managers      *)
(* (RMs) to implement the Transaction Commit specification of module       *)
(* TCommit.  In this specification, RMs spontaneously issue Prepared       *)
(* messages.  We ignore the Prepare messages that the TM can send to the   *)
(* RMs.                                                                    *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* For simplicity, we also eliminate Abort messages sent by an RM when it  *)
(* decides to abort.  Such a message would cause the TM to abort the       *)
(* transaction, an event represented here by the TM spontaneously deciding *)
(* to abort.                                                               *)

CONSTANT RM  \* The set of resource managers

VARIABLES
  rmState,       \* rmState[r] is the state of resource manager r.
  tmState,       \* The state of the transaction manager.
  tmPrepared,    \* The set of RMs from which the TM has received "Prepared"
                 \* messages.
  msgs           
    (***********************************************************************)
    (* In the protocol, processes communicate with one another by sending  *)
    (* messages.  For simplicity, we represent message passing with the    *)
    (* variable msgs whose value is the set of all messages that have been *)
    (* sent.  A message is sent by adding it to the set msgs.  An action   *)
    (* that, in an implementation, would be enabled by the receipt of a    *)
    (* certain message is here enabled by the presence of that message in  *)
    (* msgs.  For simplicity, messages are never removed from msgs.  This  *)
    (* allows a single message to be received by multiple receivers.       *)
    (* Receipt of the same message twice is therefore allowed; but in this *)
    (* particular protocol, that's not a problem.                          *)

Messages ==
  (*************************************************************************)
  (* The set of all possible messages.  Messages of type "Prepared" are    *)
  (* sent from the RM indicated by the message's rm field to the TM.       *)
  (* Messages of type "Commit" and "Abort" are broadcast by the TM, to be  *)
  (* received by all RMs.  The set msgs contains just a single copy of     *)
  (* such a message.                                                       *)
